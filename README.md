# XRoad
This gem simplifies the usage of X-Road services. Feel free to add new service classes.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'x_road'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install x_road

## Usage
There are two certificates you need to have if you want to be a member on X-road:
1. X-road membership certificate (generated by the CSR you get from the security server administrator). This certificate signs requests initiated by you, acting like a legal signature for every request.
1. Client-side certificate so that X-road security server would trust only requests from your address initiated by you and you only. This avoids for example a situation where attacker, if having access to security server, can initiate requests under your X-road sub-system to someone else.

To generate the client-side certificate you can use the following command.
**NB! Certifcate "Common Name" must be your server IP address or domain name.**

    $ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout your_xroad_application.key -out your_xroad_application.crt

Please forward your_xroad_application.crt to your X-Road security server administrator.

```ruby
require 'x_road'

XRoad.configure do |config|
  config.host = 'https://<your security server ip>/cgi-bin/consumer_proxy'
  config.client_cert = '/path/to/your_xroad_application.crt'
  config.client_key  = '/path/to/your_xroad_application.key'
  config.ssl_verify  = :peer # one of :none, :peer, :fail_if_no_peer_cert, :client_once
  config.log_level   = :debug # or one of :debug, :warn, :error, :fatal
  config.client_path = '<your server path>' # example: 'ee-test/NGO/90005872/harid' 
end
```

Now you can check what methods are available for you:

```ruby
response = XRoad::Rr.allowed_methods
response = XRoad::Ehis.allowed_methods
response = XRoad::Kpr.allowed_methods
```
